    "Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over transactional databases. The algorithm identifies the frequent individual items in the database and, as long as those itemsets appear sufficiently often in the database, extends them to larger itemsets. The frequent itemsets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database."
